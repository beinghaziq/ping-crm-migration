# Sample Readme Project

This project is a simple web application built with Ruby on Rails and Dockerized for development ease. It uses PostgreSQL as its database.

In this app I am getting the products data from the dummyjson api and using that I have implemented a functionality for users to share their thoughts about a specific product by adding a comment to it. I am saving the users and comments data in our database, so that it can be displayed later to other users on the product show page. A user can also edit or delete his/her comments.

## Features (Can add schema or relationships as well)

- Product: Represents a product fetched from the dummyjson API (Not storing it in our DB).
- Comment: Represents user comments. Each comment belongs to a product.
- List Products: View a list of products fetched from the dummyjson API.
- View Product: Click on a product title to go to show page.
- Add Comment to Product: Users can add comments to a specific product.
